Project: SmallGameFX
Tic-Tac-Toe.

- Developed in Eclipse
- Used JavaFX 21 (initially tried 24)
- Built in Maven (mvn package)
- Created a fat JAR → target/small_game_FX-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Packaged into .exe in two ways:

via jpackage (faced rendering issues)

via Launch4j — this worked smoothly

In the end:

Got a .exe file that can be launched with a double-click
